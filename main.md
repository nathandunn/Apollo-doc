### First instantaneous, collaborative genomic annotation editor available on the Web. 


Apollo is designed to support geographically dispersed researchers, and the work of a distributed community is coordinated through automatic synchronization: all edits in one client are instantly pushed to all other clients, allowing users to see annotation updates from collaborators in real-time during the editing process.  There are no installation requirements for Annotators!

- [Download the latest Apollo release](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/releases/latest) from [Github](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/).
- [Documentation](http://genomearchitect.readthedocs.io/) and available [Web Services](http://demo.genomearchitect.org/Apollo2/WebServices/) for installed instances.
- Try Apollo on our [Public Demo](demo), built with the genome of several organism including the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>).  

### Highlighted features

* Apollo is a plug-in for the [JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org) Genome Viewer.
* In addition to genes and pseudogenes, users can annotate ncRNAs (snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, rRNA), miRNAs, repeat regions, and transposable elements; each annotation type has its own configuration of the 'Information Editor'.
* History tracking with undo/redo functions is available.
* Users are able to directly set an annotation to a specific state, choosing from the 'History' display.
* Adding and updating PubMed IDs will prompt users with a publication title to confirm their submission.
* Gene Ontology (GO) terms are supported and GO ID auto-completion has been incorporated.
* Users may access a 'Recent Changes' page.
* Help page with Apollo specific content is available.
